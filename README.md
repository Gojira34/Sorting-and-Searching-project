# Sorting-and-Searchng-project WIP

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is part of **CSCI 4520 – Analysis of Algorithms** and demonstrates the implementation and efficiency analysis of two fundamental algorithms: **Merge Sort** and **Binary Search**.

The goal is to:
1. Generate 100,000 random positive numbers.
2. Search for the number `53` using **Sequential Search**.
3. Count the total occurrences of `53`.
4. Sort the array using **Merge Sort**.
5. Repeat the search using **Binary Search** on the sorted data.
6. Compare and analyze the execution times.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
### 🔹 Merge Sort
A **divide and conquer** algorithm that divides an array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges them into a sorted list.  
**Time Complexity:** Θ(n log n)  
**Space Complexity:** Θ(n)

### 🔹 Binary Search
An efficient algorithm that searches for an element in a **sorted array** by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.  
**Time Complexity:** Θ(log n)

## ⚙️ Program Workflow
1. Generate 100,000 random integers between 0 and 125.  
2. Search for `53` using Sequential Search.  
3. Count all occurrences of `53`.  
4. Sort the array using Merge Sort.  
5. Search again using Binary Search.  
6. Record and display timing results for each operation.
